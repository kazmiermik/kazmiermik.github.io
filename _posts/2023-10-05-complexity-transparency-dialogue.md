While the pandemic is not, at least for now, an immediate threat, businesses still face ongoing challenges. Every day, leaders grapple with managing in a changing, complex, and uncertain environment.

**What brought you here will not bring you there

Looking for solutions to problems they face, leaders should recognise that in today's landscape, past habits and solutions may no longer work. For example, being an effective leader now demands transparency and a willingness to admit ignorance (not knowing), which may seem contradictory to traditional authoritarian approaches.

The past couple of years have marked a prosperous period for some companies that experienced significant growth and formulated their plans and future goals with the expectation that these positive trends would endure. However, these positive trends did not endure; market conditions changed, growth slowed, and optimistic plans were unfulfilled, leaving many companies struggling to meet expectations.

**Managing Without Transparency - A Recipe for Disorientation and Trust Erosion

In situations like this, it's important to recognise that employees at different levels within an organisation often perceive the company's present condition differently. Employees at the operational level may perceive the business as performing reasonably well, while top leadership has a different view as they focus on achieving pre-established goals. In many companies, a lack of reaching planned goals leads to restrictions, such as cost-cutting measures or layoffs.

Even if such decisions are justified, a lack of transparency from the company’s leadership regarding the reasons behind these decisions can cause disorientation and frustration among employees, especially when a company suddenly implements cost-cutting measures despite a recent narrative of success. To disoriented employees, the actions of the company's management can appear chaotic and out of control, eroding employees' trust in the company's top leaders.  The lack of open communication between the 'top' and the rest of the company often arises from the challenge, and sometimes impossibility, for many leaders to admit their own ignorance – that is, not knowing everything or having all the answers.

**Operating in Complex Environments

Undoubtedly, company leadership bears the ultimate responsibility for running the business and making decisions. However, the way these decisions are made is crucial.

It's worth remembering that when conditions make it impossible to predict and control events, we enter the realm of complexity. In complex situations, expert knowledge will prove insufficient, as we are dealing with unpredictable behaviours resulting from intricate market interactions. No expert can confidently predict precise actions that will reliably yield desired results.

The path to addressing problems caused by complexity lies in focusing on small, incremental steps, making decisions gradually, and continuously adjusting actions based on feedback. Hence, transparency and communication across all levels of the organisation are crucial. Leaders at the highest levels of the organisation only have a partial view of the situation. Without adequate information flowing from the entire company, they won't be able to make the right decisions. Obtaining this information requires engaging in dialogue and asking questions.

Fear of revealing our ignorance and undermining our authority by asking questions can put us in a situation akin to one described by Polish humorist Stanisław Jerzy Lec, who wrote: "There will always be Inuits who provide guidelines for the inhabitants of the Congo on how to behave during massive heatwaves."

However, by engaging in a dialogue with the rest of the organisation, by listening to what the organisation wants to convey, leadership can gain two crucial benefits: firstly, they'll acquire the information needed to make decisions, and secondly, they'll strengthen relationships and trust at all levels of the organisation.

Effective, two-way communication becomes pivotal in times of uncertainty or new market trends. From the employees' perspective, it facilitates understanding of often painful actions, prevents disorientation and frustration, and ultimately contributes to maintaining trust and engagement. It supports the need for independent thinking and taking responsibility, both of which are crucial in such challenging moments.

The challenge for leaders, however, often lies in confronting reality, even if it means admitting their own ignorance.
